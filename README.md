# UnsupervisedML

This is my project for the lecture unsupervised machine learning at the University of Lucerne. 
I try do detect over- and underpriced houses from a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) containing information about houses sold in the year 2015.
To see my analysis run the jupyter notebook in the following order:

1.[Data Analysis]()
2.[Principle Component Analysis]()
3.[Hierarchical Clustering]()
4.[Price Outliers]()
